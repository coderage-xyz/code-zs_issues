# What is this place?

This is where we are tracking bug reports and feature suggestions for **Code: ZS**.

Please, _try not to create duplicate bug reports and feature suggestions!_

# Repositories
Each of these repositories are capable of "mentioning" (hyperlinking) and "closing" (completing) issues on repositories other than themselves (like this one). So, for the repositories we have that are private, issues concerning them are held here for public view and subsequently mentioned/closed by said private commits remotely.
| Repository | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [code-zs](https://github.com/coderage-xyz/code-zs) | Depot for all in-game assets and scripts. This is always the most likely of these repositories to be updated. |
| [code-zs_zombiesurvival](https://github.com/coderage-xyz/code-zs_zombiesurvival) | Fork of [JetBoom/zombiesurvival](https://github.com/JetBoom/zombiesurvival) housing our modified branch of the gamemode. _Note, this generally only includes changes that could easily be abstracted from all the things added in [code-zs](https://github.com/coderage-xyz/code-zs)._ |
| [code-zs_EasyChat](https://github.com/coderage-xyz/code-zs_EasyChat) | Fork of [Earu/EasyChat](https://github.com/Earu/EasyChat) housing our modified branch of the addon. As with all our forks, we changed only what we couldn't change externally from within [code-zs](https://github.com/coderage-xyz/code-zs). |
| [code-zs_bot](https://github.com/coderage-xyz/code-zs_bot) | This is the pycord bot for our Discord server that handles Discord-to-Steam account association and all other _interactive_ Discord integrations. |
